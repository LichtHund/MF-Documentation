# MF-MSG

![](../../.gitbook/assets/mfmsg.png)

### What is MF-MSG?

This is a library that allows you to parse simple Markdown messages \(based on Discord's\) into a JSON message or string.

{% hint style="info" %}
The lib works from 1.8 till 1.17. Gradients and rainbows display correctly on versions prior to 1.16, however hex colors will be converted to the closest legacy version.
{% endhint %}
